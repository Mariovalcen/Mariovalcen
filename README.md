I'm a **Full Stack Developer** transitioning into **Cybersecurity**, with a background in **Psychology** and a passion for ethical hacking, system defense, and understanding attacker behavior.

After working on full stack web development projects, I began exploring how applications, networks, and systems can be protected. Now, I'm focused on applying my skills to offensive and defensive security — while still building with a security-first mindset.
